<b>Fundamentals of Computer Programming with C#: The Bulgarian C# Book</b> is a book that I would highly recommend for anyone who has an interest in learning about C#. I can't speak for other C# books, but compared to book that I have used for C, C++, and Java, this book is great. I initially found the book under recommendation from a friend and immediately began to fall in love with it.

If you are new to the language, and programming in general, this book covers everything from the very basics (data types, conditionals, so on) and then begins to go into more C# specific features such as LINQ. Below I'll break down in bullet points the main pros and cons of the book. 

<b>Pros:</b>
<ul>
    <li>Covers the basics such as data types</li>
    <li>Goes over C# specific features well in chapters and throughout the book</li>
    <li>Provides sample programming exams at the end of the book</li>
    <li>End of chapter problems are difficult and provoke thought while still being relevant to chapter</li>
    <li>Has an online repository/website for answers to problems</li>
    <li>Contains humor to provide a little comic relief</li>
</ul>
<br />

<b>Cons:</b>
<ul>
    <li>A little outdated (certain keywords are no long supported... ArrayList as an example)</li>
    <li>Doesn't provide enough depth on certain topics in my opinion</li>
    <li>I don't agree with some of the authors' perspective on their included "best practices" sometimes</li>
</ul>
<br />
<b>Overall: </b>
I find this to be a great book and one I will probably recommend to anyone just getting started in C#. You can find my repo from my work in the book here: <a href="https://github.com/TaylorCSmith/AdditionalCSharp/tree/master/CSharp_Book_Work" style="color:orange">Repo.</a> Keep in mind that I wasn't new to programming when I started this book, so while I read through a lot of the earlier chapters, I didn't do examples for them. <br /> 

If you have any questions over the book or C# in general, feel free to ask me. I'm by no means an expert, but I'll try and provide help here I can. :)
