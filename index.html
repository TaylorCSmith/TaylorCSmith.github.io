                <h4>Fast Learner and Hard Working</h4>
                <p>I've come from knowing diddly squat in programming to working on projects from inception to commercial release in about a year. After graduating with my degree in Electrical Engineering I've been learning different programming languages passionately and in strive! Check out some of the projects I've worked on by clicking on the "More Info" button below or my github for even more!</p>

                <h4>Unique Background</h4>
                <p>Coming from Electrical Engineering to Software means that I bring a unique perspective and approach to solving problems that allows me to excel in software and been an overall benefit. While of course there were setbacks without a computer science based education, I persevere and learned a ton along the way. I talk about some of these things and others on my blog, read up if you're interested.</p>

                <h4>Joy to Hang Around</h4>
                <p>After a long day at work or on the weekends, I love to hang out with people after finishing up my work. I also love to help people out who are just learning to program or want any help or advice with switching to software from electrical engineering or elsewhere. Hit me up if you want to grab a drink or chill!</p>
