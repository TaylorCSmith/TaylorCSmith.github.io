#### Description
I worked through a book titled "Fundamentals of Computer Programming with C#" by Svetlin Navok, Veselin Kolev, & Co. The book covered the fundamentals of software development with a focus on C#. Aside from the typical fundamentals, the book also focused on LINQ and other tools specific/unique to C# 

#### Results
Overall, I really learned a lot with this book and it has been the basis for all of my other app development, regardless of language.
