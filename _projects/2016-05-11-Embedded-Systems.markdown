#### Description (From Website)
After the successful conclusion of this class, students should be able to understand the basic components of a computer, write C language programs that perform I/O functions and implement simple data structures, manipulate numbers in multiple formats, and understand how software uses global memory to store permanent information and the stack to store temporary information. Our goal is for students to learn these concepts:
<ul>
<li>Understanding how the computer stores and manipulates data</li>
<li>The understanding of embedded systems using modular design and abstractions</li>
<li>C programming: considering both function and style</li>
<li>The strategic use of memory</li>
<li>Debugging and verification using a simulator and on the real microcontroller</li>
<li>How input/output using switches, LEDs, DACs, ADCs, motors and serial ports</li>
<li>The implementation of an I/O driver, multithreaded programming</li>
<li>Understanding how local variables and parameters work</li>
<li>Analog to digital conversion (ADC), periodic sampling</li>
<li>Simple motors(e.g. open and closed-loop stepper motor control)</li>
<li>Digital to analog conversion (DAC), used to make simple sounds, design and implementation of elementary data structures</li>
<li>Introduction to the Internet of Things</li>
</ul>

#### Results
The course was pretty interesting overall. Since it covered so many topics, the course didn't go into too much detail on all of them but it gave a good overview in my opinion. It was nice coding and learning more about raw C from this course as I had never done that before and it was also cool to apply what I was already learning in school at the time to practical applications. I audited the course so no certificate was given.
