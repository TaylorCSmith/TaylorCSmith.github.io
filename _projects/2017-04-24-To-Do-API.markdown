#### Description
Based on a tutorial titled "Create a web API with ASP.NET Core and Visual Studio for Windows" by Rick Anderson and Mike Wasson. The goal was to build a web API for managing a list of "to-do" items but no UI. An overview of the API is as follows: <br>
 <ul>
 <li>GET /api/todo: Get all to-do items</li>
 <li>GET /api/todo/{id}: Get an item by ID</li>
 <li>POST /api/todo: Add a new item</li>
 <li>PUT /api/todo/{id}: Update an existing item</li>
 <li>DELETE /api/todo/{id}: Delete an time</li>
 </ul>

#### Results
This tutorial was a pretty good short introduction to Web API development. Overall I would say the project was successful. The link to the tutorial is to the right and here's a link to my repository on github for the project: <a href="https://github.com/TaylorCSmith/ToDoAPI" style="color:orange">Repository</a>
