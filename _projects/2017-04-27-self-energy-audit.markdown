#### Self Energy Audit API
Part of the Earthhack HackDFW event. It was a hackathon focused on forming some kind of app to help with sustainability. We decided to create a web application that allowed someone to perform their own energy audit at home. Basically, the idea was for users to go onto our website, create a profile, and enter basic information about the big energy consumers in their home... like their washing machine and so on. Month to month, if anything changed like they got a new washing machine, we would show them the impact and difference it would have both cost wise as well as power consuption differences.  

#### Results:
Our project was a pretty basic one which fullfilled the base requirements for what we were aiming for (it's set up for easy scalability). For me this was a really big projects because it sort of solidified my belief that a career in CS instead of EE was that I wanted to do.
