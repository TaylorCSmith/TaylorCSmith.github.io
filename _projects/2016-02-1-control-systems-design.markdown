#### Description
A lab course offered by MITx with the following course overview ("What You'll Learn: " as described on the website):
<ul>
<li> How to set up a control system and understand and optimize its performance</li>
<li>Modeling Feedback Control system using Difference Equations</li>
<li>What unstable systems are like, practically and mathematically</li>
<li>How to measure control system performance</li>
<li>How proportional, delta, and summation feedback reduce tracking errors and increase disturbance rejection</li>
</ul>

#### Results
The course was quite successful for me. At the conclusion, I had basic knowledge of different Control Systems topics and how to apply them as well as an introduction to using PowerShell and Python. The course also expanded my knowledge on microcontroller usage and basic electrical engineering concepts.
