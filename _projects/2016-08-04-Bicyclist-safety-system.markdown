#### Abstract
Part of a Senior Design project in which I worked on a team of 5 people to build the project described in the following abstract. "The purpose of this system is to create a bicycle mounted system to improve the safety of bicyclist by increasing their visibility to others and for themselves. The main parts of our project are a headlight, a break light, and turn signals that are integrated into a raspberry pi system which automatically turns them on at the appropriate times and has additional manual controls. The system will also include a camera which displays dangers behind the bicyclist onto a monitor mounted to the handlebars of the bicycle. We will demonstrate a working prototype that is mounted to a bike with working sub-systems. The system will greatly improve bicyclist safety, be low cost, and not impair the bicyclists ability to operate their bicycle; all goals of our project."

#### Results
The project was a success overall as we were able to achieve the majority of our objectives and the system was functional. If allowed more time, probably the top thing we would have done is make it look nicer... it wasn't the prettiest of projects. We would also have probably worked to minimize the overall size. Despite the fact that we were well within our weight objective, it was a bit clunky.
