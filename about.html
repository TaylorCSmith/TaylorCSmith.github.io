            <h4>More About Me.</h4>
            <p>Hi! My name is Taylor Smith and I'm a recent graduate from The University of Texas at Dallas with a Bechelor's of Science degree in Electrical Engineering. While at UTD I discovered that electrical engineering concepts just weren't something I could really get into or be passionate about. As a result, I've moved onto software development and have taken steps to ensure that I move in that direction with my career!</p>
            <h4>My Hopes for This Website</h4>
            <p>The primary purposes of this website will be as follows:
                <ul>
                    <li>A blog detailing what I'm currently working on among other things</li>
                    <li>A page with a portfolio of my projects with github links for the open-source ones</li>
                    <li>Information on my twitch channel if that ever comes to fruition</li>
            </p>
            <p>While you go around this site, keep in mind that it is currently a work in progress. Additionally, depending on the stage the site is in, I do not hold the rights to the majority of the photos currently visible on the site (they're being replaced) nor did I make the initial layout for this site. For information on the original layout and dev, check out this github repo: <a href="https://github.com/st4ple/solid-jekyll">Solid-Jekyll</a>
